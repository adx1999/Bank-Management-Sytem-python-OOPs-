# Bank-Management-Sytem-python-OOPs-
## 1. Project Description
The Bank Management System is a simple Python project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows users to create a bank account, deposit money, withdraw funds, check their balance, and view their transaction history.

## 2. OOP Concepts Used
- Encapsulation: All account details and transactions are stored within a class.
- Abstraction: User interacts with high-level methods like deposit() and withdraw() without needing to know internal workings.
- Modularity: The system is structured with methods for each banking operation, making it easy to maintain and extend.
## 3. Features
- Account Creation – Users can enter their name, account number, and initial balance.
- Deposit Money – Users can add funds to their account.
- Withdraw Money – Ensures users can withdraw only if they have sufficient balance.
- Check Balance – Displays the current balance of the user.
- Transaction History – Stores and shows a record of all transactions.
